## Hi, I'm C.J. ðŸ‘‹

[**Find my personal website here**](https://cj-robinson.github.io/)

My full name is Christopher, but mostly I go by C.J. (sometimes CJ).

Iâ€™m currently a student at the Columbia Journalism School pursuing an M.S. in Data Journalism.

I enjoy transit, cities, coffee and games.

Most recently, I was a senior data analyst for the New York Times Games team using user engagement data to understand what makes games like Wordle, Strands, Connections, and the Crossword more engaging + enjoyable (plus doing some fun Wordle strategy analysis).
